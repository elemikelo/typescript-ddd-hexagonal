# TypeScript DDD Hexagonal Architecture Example ðŸ’£
This is a TypeScript project that follows Domain-Driven Design (DDD) principles and Hexagonal Architecture. It uses Mongoose as the database ORM and follows best practices for developing scalable and maintainable applications. The project is structured into four main layers:

**Domain**: contains the business logic and entities of the application.

**Application**: contains the use cases and business logic of the application.

**Infrastructure**: contains the implementation details and frameworks, such as database and API connectors.

**Interfaces**: contains the entry points of the application, such as REST API controllers.

>The project includes examples for the Subscription entity, including the domain model, application service, and 
repository interfaces and implementations. The code follows clean coding practices and includes comments and documentation to make it easy to understand and maintain.
